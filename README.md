A TypeScript utilities repository using React + TypeScript + Vite

## About

This repository serves as a growing and comprehensive reference for TypeScript functions, helpers, and utilities that I frequently use across my various projects. It is intended to streamline my development process by providing reusable code snippets that address common and complex programming tasks. The codebase spans from general utilities to specific use-cases tailored for web development, data processing, and more.

## Structure

- **Web Development:** Functions that facilitate both front-end and back-end operations, including API utilities, DOM manipulation helpers, and more.
- **Data Processing:** Tools for handling, transforming, and validating data, suitable for backend processing and frontend applications.
- **Utilities:** General-purpose functions that can be universally applied across projects to solve various programming challenges like string manipulation, number calculations, and data cloning.

Each directory is organized by topic, and within those, you'll find subdirectories that focus on specific aspects or use-cases related to the main topic.
